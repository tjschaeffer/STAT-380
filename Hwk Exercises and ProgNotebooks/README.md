## Instructions for STAT 380 MDSR Homework Exercises


### General

Each week, you should create a new .Rmd AND R Notebook in this repository for your Homework Exercises (**all MDSR homework documents in this repository**). Specific details corresponding to each assignment will be found in Canvas.


### Template Description

- File naming: "LastName_MDSR_Chap_05_Hwk.Rmd"  with chapter number updated for each assignment
- A .Rmd template document is available with the required elements
    - title (same each time)
    - subtitle (update to reflect chapters assigned)
    - name (same each time)
    - due date
    - front matter (clean workspace & load all packages in use)
    - 3rd level heading for each assigned problem (e.g. "### Exercise 5.2")
- Each assigned problem should be well-formatted with appropriate narrative and code chunks.
    - if the question has multiple parts, your solution must make clear when you are addressing each part
    - if the book lists prompts in bullet points, than your solution should match
    - if the book uses a numbered list (1., 2., 3., etc) than your solution should match
    - if the book uses a lettered list (a., b., c., etc) than your solution should match

### Submitting Work

- Submit your finished HTML R Notebook to **Canvas** to be graded (i.e. NOT just committed in GitHub). 
- Rmd can be submitted for partial credit if unable to render the HTML R Notebook properly.  

### GitHub Monitoring/Grading

- GitHub use graded holistically at end of term based on review of your Repo
    - BOTH ".Rmd" and ".nb.html" present for each MDSR assignment
    - commit record for each assignment
        - minimum of 3 commits per assignment (e.g. initial commit; something intermediate; final commit)
        - ideally, it would be good practice to have at least one commit for each exercise
