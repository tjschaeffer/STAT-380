# Exploring Randomness in Simulations

## Instructions

This assigment includes both specific tasks to perform and open-ended questions to investigate. Submit your completed work as an HTML R Notebook to Canvas (Rmd submitted for partial credit).
 

## Grading 

### Overall Quality [10 pts] 

The overall quality of the work submitted will be graded in addition to the content of your analysis.  For example, be sure that:** 

- all code is consistent with the STAT 380 Style Guide;
- all plots have informative titles, axis labels, and legends;
- narrative descriptions are well-written.  Lists or bullet points are fine, but the text should be complete sentances free of significant spelling, grammar and other issues.
