\copyright Copyright Matthew Beckman (2019).  Content of this assessment (e.g., documents, Git repositories, etc) may NOT be shared, copied, used, or reproduced for any reason without expressed written permission of Dr. Matthew Beckman (<mdb268@psu.edu>). 


## Introduction 

This assessment will include exploration of `flights` data, which can be accessed from the `nycflights13` R package, as well as weather data provided by the United States National Climactic Data Center (NCDC) provided to you in the GitHub Classroom repository provided to accompany the take-home portion of the midterm exam.


## Documents

- **nycWeather2013.csv** contains 2013 daily weather data for three airports in the New York City area.
- **nycWeather2013_DataSummary.pdf** is the data description document provided by the NCDC to accompany our specific data set.
- **STAT380_TakeHome_Midterm_SP19.pdf** is a complete description of the Take-Home Midterm assessment
- **LASTNAME-stat380-Midterm.Rmd** is an RMarkdown template for the assessment.  Please rename the document with your last name prior to submitting your work in Canvas.



## Logistics

**Canvas**: Submit your completed HTML R Notebook (with embedded Rmd) to Canvas before the due date.  If you are unable to render the R Notebook, you may submit your Rmd directly for partial credit.

**GitHub**: You are required to make at least 4 substantive GitHub commits during your work on the midterm.  Also, your completed assignment must be entirely reproducible, meaning a grader with access only to your GitHub Repo should be able to execute your Rmd document and produce your final HTML R Notebook with absolutely no modification required.
