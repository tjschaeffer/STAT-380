# Bike Sharing and Local Weather Investigation

## Instructions

This assigment includes both specific tasks to perform and open-ended questions to investigate. The open-ended questions ask you to use statistical / data science thinking to decide on a plot to make and to summarize information gleaned from these visualizations.

There are 4 parts to this assignment: 

- data preparation, 
- exploring the distribution of bike share users, 
- exploring the relationship between time and rider counts, 
- exploring the relationship between weather and rider counts. 
    
The data preparation section gives you specific tasks to perform. Then in each of the next three sections, you are asked to create 2 plots. The first plot is described in some detail and the second plot is one of your choosing. Be sure to choose a plot that provides additional information about the distributions and relationships in the data. Remember that we are interested in how ride sharing works so, e.g., plots that examine the weather in DC without reference to ride sharing are not interesting.


## Grading

Submit your completed work as an HTML R Notebook to Canvas (Rmd submitted for partial credit).

### Overall Quality [10 pts] 

The overall quality of the work submitted will be graded in addition to the content of your analysis.  For example, be sure that:** 

- all code is consistent with the STAT 380 Style Guide;
- all plots have informative titles, axis labels, and legends;
- narrative descriptions are well-written.  Lists or bullet points are fine, but the text should be complete sentances free of significant spelling, grammar and other issues.
