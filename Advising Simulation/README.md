# Advising Simulation

## Instructions

*Many academic departments have walk-in academic advising during busy periods in the semester (e.g., Drop/Add week).  The Department of Statistics currently has one academic advisor on staff.  We are interested in using simulation to understand how long students are likely to wait for walk-in advising during these busy periods.  Furthermore, the head of the statistics department would like to understand the potential impact if it were possible to hire a second advisor to assist during those periods.*


## Grading 

### Overall Quality [10 pts] 

**The overall quality of the work submitted will be graded in addition to the content of your analysis.  For example, be sure that:** 

- all code is consistent with the STAT 380 Style Guide;
- all plots have informative titles, axis labels, and legends;
- narrative descriptions are well-written.  Lists or bullet points are fine, but the text should be free of significant spelling, grammar and other issues.
